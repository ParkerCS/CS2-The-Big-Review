#PART 4 - CONDITIONS (30pts TOTAL)

# PROBLEM 1 (Fibonacci - 4pts)
## The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers that starts with 1, followed by 1 again.
# Every next number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
# I.e., the sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...
# Write a program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence
# until the numbers get higher than 1000.


# PROBLEM 2 (Number Guessing Game - 6pts)
# Write a program that takes a random integer between 1 and 1000
# The program then asks the user to guess the number.
# After every guess, the program will say either “Lower”
# if the number it took is lower, “Higher” if the number it took is higher,
# and “You guessed it!” if the number it took is equal to the number
# It might be wise, for testing purposes, to also display the number that the
# program randomly picks, until you are sure that the program works correctly

# PROBLEM 3 (Dice Hi-Low - 6pts)
# You roll five six-sided dice, one by one.
# How big is the probability that the value of each die
# is greater than or equal to the value of the previous die that you rolled?
# For example, the sequence “1, 1, 4, 4, 6” is a success,
# but “1, 1, 4, 3, 6” is not. Determine the
# probability of success using a simulation of a large number of trials.

# PROBLEM 4 (Number Puzzler - 6pts)
# A, B, C, and D are all different digits.
# The number DCBA is equal to 4 times the number ABCD.
# What are the digits?
# Note: to make ABCD and DCBA conventional numbers, neither A nor D can be zero.
# Use a quadruple-nested loop to solve.

# PROBLEM 5 ( Pirate Monkey Problem- 8pts)
# According to an old puzzle, five pirates and their monkey are stranded on an island.
# During the day they gather coconuts, which they put in a big pile.
# When night falls, they go asleep.
# In the middle of the night, the first pirate wakes up,
# and, not trusting his buddies, he divides the pile into five equal parts,
# takes what he believes to be his share and hides it.
# Since he had one coconut left after the division, he gives it to the monkey. Then he goes
# back to sleep. An hour later, the next pirate wakes up. He behaves in the same way as the first pirate:
#he divides the pile into five equal shares, with one coconut left over which he gives to the
#monkey, hides what he believes to be his share, and goes to sleep again.
#The same happens to the other pirates: they wake up one by one, divide the pile, give one
#coconut to the monkey, hide their share, and go back to sleep.
#In the morning they all wake up. They divide what remains of the coconuts equally
#amongst them. Since that leaves one coconut, they give it to the monkey.
# The question is: what is the smallest number of coconuts that they can have started with?
#Write a Python program that solves this puzzle.
# If you can solve it for any number of pirates, all the better.
