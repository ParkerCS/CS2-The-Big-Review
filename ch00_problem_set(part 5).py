#PART 5 - FUNCTIONS (20PTS TOTAL)
#In these exercises you write functions. Of course, you should not only write the functions,
#you should also write code to test them. For practice, you should also comment your
#functions as explained above.



#PROBLEM 1 (Multiplication table- 3pts)
#Create a function that gets a number as parameter, and then prints the
#multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10. E.g., when the parameter is 12, the first
#line printed is “1 * 12 = 12” and the last line printed is “10 * 12 = 120.”


# PROBLEM 2 (Calculating PI - 4pts)
# The Grerory-Leibnitz series approximates pi as 4 ∗ (1/1 − 1/3 + 1/5 − 1/7 + 1/9...).
# Write a function that returns the approximation of pi according to this series.
# The function gets one parameter, namely an integer that indicates how many of the terms
# between the parentheses must be calculated.

# PROBLEM 3 (Common letters - 7pts)
# Write a function that takes two words as parameters,
# and prints all the characters that the words have in common.
# Consider capitals the same as the lower case letters.
# Each character that you report, should be reported only once
# (e.g., the strings “bee” and “peer” only have one character in common, the letter “e”).
# Hint: Gather the characters in a third string,
# and when you find a character that the two words have in common,
# check if it is already in the third string before reporting it.

# PROBLEM 4 (Prime Numbers - 6pts)
# A prime number is a positive integer that is dividable by exactly two
# different numbers, namely 1 and itself.
# The lowest (and only even) prime number is 2.
# The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
# Write a function that takes a number as a parameter
# and then RETURNS True or False whether or not it is prime.
# Hint: In a loop where you test the possible dividers of the number,
# you can conclude that the number is not prime as soon as you encounter a number
# other than 1 or itself that divides it.
# However, you can only conclude that it actually is prime
# after you have tested all possible dividers.
